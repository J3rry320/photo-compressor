**photo-compressor** CLI is a command-line tool to optimize and compress images locally or from the cloud. This tool leverages sharp to perform image compression and conversion to `.webp` format. It's a great utility for web developers to convert their media to `.webp` and compress them to serve easily to their end users.

## Features

-   Optimize images in a local directory
    
-   Optimize images from a URL or a directory of image URLs
    
-   Automatically handles file name conflicts
    
-   Provides detailed logging with statistics on savings and processing time
    

## Installation

Install the CLI globally using npm:



```bash
npm install -g photo-compressor
```
or use yarn 
```bash
yarn global add photo-compressor
```
or use npx to run it without installation 
```bash
npx photo-compressor
```

### Common Options

-   `-h, --help`: Display help information for a command.
    
-   `-V, --version`: Output the current version of the package.
    

### Commands

#### `photo-compressor local`

**Description**: Optimize and compress images in a local directory.

**Usage**:



```bash
photo-compressor local --dir <path_to_directory> --output <path_to_output_directory>
```

**Options**:

-   `-d, --dir <path>`: Directory to scan for images (Required).
    
-   `-o, --output <path>`: Output directory for optimized images, default is `./optimized`.
    



#### `photo-compressor cloud`

**Description**: Optimize and compress images from a URL or a directory URL.

**Usage**:



```bash
photo-compressor cloud --url <image_url_OR_array_of_images> --output <path_to_output_directory>
```

**Options**:

-   `-u, --url <url>`: URL of the image or an array of image URLs to compress (Required).
    
-   `-o, --output <path>`: Output directory for optimized images, default is `./optimized`.
    

**Notes**:

-   `--url` option can take a single image URL or an array of image URLs for batch processing.


## Examples

### Optimize Local Images


```bash
photo-compressor local --dir ./images --output ./optimized
```

### Optimize Cloud Images

## Notes

1.  This is yet another wrapper around sharp. Further optimizations will be added down the road, but it is a good utility to convert and optimize a bunch of images hassle-free.
    
2.  I was watching Silicon Valley and wanted to build something related to compression. (P.S. I'm a noob)
    
3.  This is a good utility tool for web developers to compress and convert a bunch of images to `.webp`.
